# M1 Internship - Research project 
During my Master 1, I had the opportunity to join Dr. Nicolas Reynoirdâ€™s team at the IAB to investigate the role of BCAR1 in the SMYD2-BCAR3-FMNLs axis in triple-negative breast cancer.

## Project  
### Abstract
<p align="justify">
Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. While early-stage interventions targeting the primary tumor have significantly improved, strategies to prevent or treat aggressive breast cancer and metastasis remain less effective. Tumor dissemination is a major contributor to mortality in breast cancer patients. Dr. Reynoird's team has observed that BCAR3 methylation by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 enhances cancer cell migration and invasiveness. Their research demonstrated that SMYD2 plays a role in breast cancer metastasis and that BCAR3 methylation facilitates its interaction with the actin nucleator FMNL3.
In this projet we investigated the role of BCAR1 in the SMYD2-BCAR3 pathway in breast cancer cells by assessing whether BCAR1/BCAR3 abrogation affects cytoskeletal remodeling. We found that BCAR1 and BCAR3 are expressed and interact in aggressive breast cancer cell lines. Using specific mutants, we demonstrated that BCAR1 interacts with FMNL3 through BCAR3, highlighting the importance of this complex in cytoskeletal dynamics.

<p align="center" style="font-size: 12px;"><em>
<strong>BCAR1</strong> interacts with <strong>BCAR3</strong> (1), which undergoes <strong>SMYD2 methylation</strong> at lysine 334 (2). This modification facilitates the recruitment of <strong>formin-like proteins (FMNLs)</strong>. Upon binding to methylated BCAR3, FMNLs become activated, enhancing actin polymerization (3). The increased actin assembly promotes plasma membrane extensions, leading to lamellipodia formation and contributing to cellular migration.
